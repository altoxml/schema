## [Documentation] (https://github.com/altoxml/documentation/wiki)

ALTO (Analyzed Layout and Text Object) is an XML Schema that details technical metadata for describing the layout and content of physical text resources, such as pages of a book or a newspaper. It most commonly serves as an extension schema used with the [Metadata Encoding and Transmission Schema (METS)] (http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/). However, ALTO instances can also exist as a standalone document used independently of METS.
